Then the next day we started by melting the chocolate in a double boiler with the butter. We then mixed the eggs with the brown sugar, and slowly added the chocolate into the egg mixture. We added what we thought was flour and poured the batter into buttered and sugared ramekins. I dropped a blob of ganache into each one and filled the ramekins up.</p>\n<p>However, we realized we forgot to preheat the oven, so while that was happening, we decided to see what garnishes we could add to the final product. He suggested powdered sugar and started to look for it in the pantry. We then realized that we had added powdered sugar into the batter instead of flour, so we poured out all the batter to add the flour back in. We also had to make another batch of ganache since it melted into the batter.</p>\n<p>Finally, a few hours later, we preheated the oven and reassembled the lava cakes. We baked them for about 15 minutes and plated one up. The bottom of the cake was very melty probably because some of the old batter was stuck to the ramekin. The cake was definitely very sweet, but overall, it turned out well!</p>","excerpt":"This weekend, my boyfriend and I attempted to make chocolate lava cakes, based on the recipe from Binging with Babish (recipe link here), and it wasâ€¦","frontmatter":{"date":"September 07, 2020","slug":"/chocolatelavacake","title":"Chocolate Lava Cakes - Baking Adventures","description":"Chocolate lava cakes","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#888888","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/19350be38e00a37d291c80c09d2a1a89/c381f/img_8659-copy.jpg","srcSet":"/static/19350be38e00a37d291c80c09d2a1a89/2a90a/img_8659-copy.jpg 350w,\n/static/19350be38e00a37d291c80c09d2a1a89/8887d/img_8659-copy.jpg 700w,\n/static/19350be38e00a37d291c80c09d2a1a89/a0167/img_8659-copy.jpg 1050w,\n/static/19350be38e00a37d291c80c09d2a1a89/bc763/img_8659-copy.jpg 1400w,\n/static/19350be38e00a37d291c80c09d2a1a89/c381f/img_8659-copy.jpg 1980w","sizes":"(min-width: 1980px) 1980px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/19350be38e00a37d291c80c09d2a1a89/1def9/img_8659-copy.webp 350w,\n/static/19350be38e00a37d291c80c09d2a1a89/b34d1/img_8659-copy.webp 700w,\n/static/19350be38e00a37d291c80c09d2a1a89/aa237/img_8659-copy.webp 1050w,\n/static/19350be38e00a37d291c80c09d2a1a89/31c97/img_8659-copy.webp 1400w,\n/static/19350be38e00a37d291c80c09d2a1a89/9db60/img_8659-copy.webp 1980w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1980px) 1980px, 100vw"}]},"width":1980,"height":768}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"98b3d896-91cf-5937-b3d4-330a75fecf72","previous":{"id":"b77dc85b-1c38-5c7d-94d2-2fd0b1cd87f4","frontmatter":{"slug":"/patrizis","template":"blog-post","title":"Patrizi's"}},"next":{"id":"7fa106a2-8497-54ea-b621-02116af5ce2f","frontmatter":{"slug":"/quarantinecooking2","template":"blog-post","title":"Quarantine Cooking: Pt. 2"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["228695001","4267595483"],"slicesMap":{}}
